<h2><a name="Q1"></a>Question 1</h2>
<p>Please give one to three specific examples of actions you’ve taken in the past to increase the overall amount of housing in Somerville.
<br><br>
How effective were those actions? If you could go back, what would you change?</p>

		<td>During my time on the council, I have taken several actions to increase the overall amount and types of housing in Somerville. In one instance, I collaborated with Councilor Ewen-Campen and City staff from the Mobility and Engineering departments to end mandatory parking minimums in Somerville. By eliminating these mandates, I helped reduce costs for housing developers by thousands of dollars per parking spot (which they are still allowed to build if they want), removed a requirement that studies have found increases car use and traffic congestion, as well as opened up additional opportunities for green space. Like all zoning changes, the full impact of this change will not happen overnight. But it will help reduce costs at a time of economic uncertainty for housing developers.<br><br>Continuing the theme of zoning changes, I have also taken strides on an effort I committed to in the 2021 Somerville YIMBY Questionnaire. In that document, I said I would like to increase the amount of accessible housing in the City. This is incredibly important in order to create an inclusive community where everyone can age-in-place, if they so choose. In November of 2024, I put forward an order for City staff to figure out how we could adjust our zoning to ease the ability of residents to change their homes to be more accessible through adding elevators or changing their means of egress. In June of this year, the council passed the legislative changes necessary to waive certain dimensional standards for means of egress. As a resident and a councilor, I believe that if our community values accessibility, then we must legislate it and fund it.<br><br>Finally, I have taken multiple votes to directly fund more affordable housing in Somerville; both directly in terms of additional funding for the Clarendon Hill redevelopment which will add 295 market-rate units, 80 new affordable apartments, in addition to the 216 replacement public housing units and indirectly through voting for an UCH-TIF Agreement for the 299 Broadway project, which will add replace the derelict Star Market on Broadway with new commercial space, arts and community space, and 288 units of housing, 132 of which will be income-restricted.</td>
		<td>In 2022 I introduced and successfully achieved passage of a zoning ordinance amendment that removed site plan approval for backyard cottages, effectively making them a by-right option for property owners looking to add an accessory dwelling unit.<br><br>Since 2021 I’ve been heavily involved with the 299 Broadway site, the Somerville Redevelopment Authority’s urban renewal plan there, and the proposal to redevelop that as a mixed-use development with a high percentage of affordable housing. I’ve served on the Winter Hill Civic Advisory Committee for years and worked with the developer (Mark Development), the community, and City staff on a very complex but exciting Chapter 40B project. Ultimately approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals, the final numbers for the project include 319 new housing units, with 136 of those being affordable units.<br><br>Following the addition of Type IV construction (mass timber) to the state building code this past fall, I introduced an order for the council to discuss with relevant City staff in Planning, Preservation, and Zoning and Inspectional Services what we are doing as a municipality to be prepared for Type IV construction. Type IV construction is a very important potential solution to the financial donut hole that exists between seven and 12 stories, where it’s too tall for “5 Over 1” (Type V timber framing on a Type I steel-framed podium) and it’s not tall enough for Type V (steel frame) to make financial sense.<br><br>In terms of effectiveness, the backyard cottage zoning change has led to more backyard cottage ADUs being created in the city. I know this because I’ve talked to people who have done this. It’s also led to multi-member bodies being able to use their time better by not having to take up site plan approval of these. I think there still are things to be tweaked in terms of dimensional, form, and setback requirements to truly unlock our ADU potential, but this was a clear step forward.<br><br>Following the approval of the finalized UCH-TIF and two easement agreements by the City Council earlier this month, the developer is set to break ground on the 299 Broadway project in September. There will be a celebration of the start of demolition that figures to draw a large crowd from the neighborhood and beyond. I do think there’s work to be done in letting people know what’s happening there, as I talk to people still who have no idea this site is being redeveloped.<br><br>My order on the discussion about Type IV construction has been in the Land Use Committee since I introduced it earlier this year. The Land Use Committee has had a number of extremely time-consuming and hugely important decisions before us in the spring and early summer, so we have yet to take up that order of mine (along with another on financing for transit-oriented development). I always could’ve pushed to have my orders taken up, though I have a promise from the chair to take those up after the summer recess. I do agree we’re likely to have a much more productive discussion than we would’ve had prior to recess.</td>

<h2><a name="Q2"></a>Question 2</h2>
<p>Our neighbors in Cambridge have updated their zoning to allow residential buildings of up to 4 stories citywide — 6 if they include affordable housing at Somerville's 20% level.
<br><br>
Would you support a similar change that would legalize buildings of up to 6 stories by right (without special permits) citywide?
<br><br>
Why or why not?</p>

				<td>I would support such a measure. That said, I would look for a way to prioritize this development in neighborhoods that are not as dense. East Somerville and Union Square shouldn't be the only neighborhoods to be impacted by this.</td>
		<td>Cambridge recently did a major update to their zoning that previously had single-family zoning in some areas of the city. Ever since, I’ve been asked by many constituents if Somerville would follow the lead of our neighbors to the south. My answer has been that Somerville remains ahead of Cambridge on zoning with our form-based zoning that resulted from the 2019 zoning overhaul, but there are things we can do to maintain that advantage.<br><br>The Land Use Committee took the long-anticipated step of taking up transit-oriented upzoning in the many areas of the city now served by transit stations. Throughout the spring and early summer we got a background on how other communities have gone about this process, the current landscape in Somerville, and the effectiveness of different zoning districts in terms of achieving the desired result. I intend to begin making motions for map changes in our meetings when the Land Use Committee returns from summer recess.<br><br>This targeted transit-oriented upzoning is a smarter, better approach than a blanket city-wide approach. Not only does it recognize where we really need to be building more housing (around transit stations), but it also avoids accelerating displacement in the city. Somerville still has a decent amount of “naturally-occurring affordable housing.” Make no mistake: market forces are coming for this housing and our low-income, working class, immigrant, and artist communities are at great risk of displacement as a result. We need to avoid pouring gasoline on that fire by targeting these areas for development instead of the logical target around transit.<br><br>Interestingly, one of the findings presented to the Land Use Committee was how productive Urban Residential zoning districts have proven to be at creating new housing. While I definitely prefer denser zoning districts in the areas immediately around transit stations, I definitely intend to push for increasing the amount of the city zoned Urban Residence. This should help with housing production in Somerville. <br><br>Copying Cambridge with blanket, city-wide zoning isn’t a good idea for Somerville. We’re a different city with different populations and we need to be pursuing a better strategy that works for us. I’ll be watching closely to see what happens in Cambridge and apply any lessons here.</td>

<h2><a name="Q3"></a>Question 3</h2>
<p>The city’s long-range plan, Somervision 2040, sets non-binding goals and guidelines, some of which compete or conflict. Which goals are most important to you? Which would you give less emphasis?</p>

		<td>Frankly, each topic covered in the report is important to me and should be to any candidate for mayor. That said, housing, the development of our arts ecosystem and nightlife, community and governance, as well as the development of green infrastructure are particularly important to me. If I had to give less emphasis to something, it would be to the development of privately-owned public spaces (POPS). I like might public spaces to actually be public.</td>
		<td>I have my concerns about Somervision 2040 after taking part in it as a community member. Whereas its predecessor, Somervision 2023 felt very organic and community-driven, the current version of it was very much led by City staff, with the community taking on more of a supporting role. Still, it’s what we have and it plays an important role in defining our plans for what we want Somerville to be and how to get there.<br><br>Of the goals and guidelines spelled out in Somervision 2024, I’d say the most important are meeting our target level of affordable housing, a transformative approach to addressing infrastructure, and a centralized source of information. These are all issues I’ve been campaigning on as a mayoral candidate and central to what I want to accomplish as mayor.<br><br>I’ll name two things I’d like to see be different in Somervision 2050.<br><br>The first is a revisiting of the idea that we have a map of Somerville with areas that are designated as places to Transform, Enhance, or Conserve. I think we’re selling people a fiction with the idea that we can conserve a neighborhood or an area of the city. It’s simply not possible to lock something into amber like that. We’re either seeing investments and improvements made to some degree – either Transforming or Enhancing – or we’re not. And if we’re not making those investments or improvements, we’re effectively neglecting that area of the city and allowing it to degrade. If I’m Mayor when it comes time for Somervision 2050, we’ll take a different approach to that map.<br><br>The other change to the goals and guidelines I’d suggest is expanding Safe Routes to Parks to include Schools. I’m convinced more students and their families would walk or bike to school if doing so didn’t feel so unsafe. I’ve pushed City staff to get creative with School Streets, both during the school day and at arrival and dismissal to make sure the streets around our schools are safe for everyone.</td>

<h2><a name="Q4"></a>Question 4</h2>
<p>Many tenant protections require state legislative action in the form of an approved Home Rule Petition. What tenant protections would you put into a Home Rule Petition?</p>

		<td>As a councilor, I have tried to do what I can in my limited legal capacity to expand tenant rights. The first law I ever proposed was a Tenants’ Know Your Rights law. Furthermore, I have voted on a Home Rule Petition that would give tenants the right to purchase their homes in the event of a sale before it goes to market. If possible, I wish the City could have the second right to purchase the home before it goes to market, as a anti-displacement tool. I have also voted on a Home Rule Petition for a local form of rent control.<br><br>But Somerville deserves a mayor with a record of results, not just one who talks. That's why I'm proud of my regional and successful push to end forced broker fees. I worked with city councilors from Boston and Cambridge to put forward Home Rule Petitions around the same time that would require whoever hires the broker pays the broker. This gave additional momentum to an important issue that costs renters thousands of dollars, potentially every time they move. By ending them, we lowered the barrier of entry to our housing market and saved Somerville residents money. And, afterwards, I was gratified to be thanked by multiple of our state representatives and even State Senator Lydia Edwards.</td>
	<td>I’ve voted for a resolution in support of bills at the state level that would provide local options for tenant protections. While we await that help from Beacon Hill, Somerville has been busy both with Home Rule Petitions and local ordinance to do more to help tenants.<br><br>I’ve already voted for a Home Rule Petition in 2023 to allow Somerville to enact rent stabilization here in our city. It’s a common-sense approach that wouldn’t impact the many good and savvy landlords who already practice their own rent stabilization policy by not hitting tenants with exorbitant rent increases, opting to prioritize keeping tenants over the tenant churn that comes with always chasing market rents.<br><br>Just cause eviction protections were a key component of that 2023 Home Rule Petition. This requires that any eviction only happen on very specific grounds, including failure to pay rent, a substantial violation of the lease, substantial damage to the rental unit by the tenant, serious criminal activity by the tenant that constitutes a threat to others, intended use and occupancy by a family member, or demolition or conversion to a condo or non-residential use.<br><br>Relocation fees when a tenant is being displaced at no fault of their own are another important tenant protection. These currently are included in our condo conversion ordinance, but are worth inserting into future tenant protection home rule petitions.</td>

<h2><a name="Q5"></a>Question 5</h2>
<p>The Office of Housing Stability is one of several ways that our city currently helps tenants. What would you do <u>within the city’s current powers</u> to improve our tenant protections?</p>

		<td>Beyond increasing funding to the department to hire case managers and for programs like our Municipal Voucher Program, the actual protections themselves are matters of how we raise awareness and enforcement of our laws. The first law that I proposed as a councilor was a tenants’ rights law. This amendment to the Housing Stability Notification Act requires that all landlords send a City-approved document to new tenants in their primary language, including their tenant rights and resources, within 5 days of their tenancy via email, certified mail, or in-hand. As mayor, I would work to increase awareness of this law, possibly through an annual or once-a-term mailing, and push for compliance.<br><br>Another important element of tenant protections are our fair housing laws. During the City of Somerville’s FY26 budget review, I asked our Housing Division of OSCPD whether they conduct fair housing checks, which is one way we could collect data about which landlords or brokers are perpetuating housing discrimination. Her answer was no. Many years ago, I learned how to conduct a fair housing check when I was an intern at the Equal Rights Center, a civil rights non-profit that specializes in identifying discrimination in housing, public accommodations, and employment. This is an incredibly important way that the City is failing to follow up on complaints of housing discrimination, which the council receives a report about each year. That is tacit acceptance of a critical harm to our neighbors, based on their backgrounds. As mayor, I will work to fund these checks in Somerville either through additional staff within the Housing Division or through partnering with a local organization so we can fight to be the inclusive community we claim to be.</td>
	<td>The City Council is set to vote on an update to our condo conversion ordinance when we return from summer recess. I’m supportive of this ordinance change that would disincentivize property owners from pursuing some of the end-arounds that we’ve seen happening to avoid incurring relocation fees to tenants being displaced by planned condo conversions.<br><br>I receive a fair number of constituent reports of unsafe conditions in their rental units. I think it’s worth looking at how we’re handling enforcement of the State Sanitary Code. It’s technically the Board of Health that is responsible for this, but we need to work with Inspectional Services to make sure we’re investigating potential violations to keep residents safe.<br><br>Fair Housing is another area where we can do more as a municipality. From obvious discrimination to more subtle forms, we can do better by tenants by ensuring landlords are following the Fair Housing Act. For example, I often hear how it’s particularly tough for families to get an apartment, due to discrimination against households with children. Individuals with mobile vouchers also often face income-source discrimination, in violation of state law.</td>

<p><a href="https://www.somervillema.gov/departments/programs/vision-zero-somerville">Somerville’s Safe Streets Ordinance</a> is a commitment to eliminating traffic violence and improving non-car transportation options.
<br><br>
If elected, how will you support the implementation of the Safe Streets ordinance and Bicycle Network Plan?</p>

		<td>As the sponsor of this ordinance, there is no one in this race who is more committed to seeing this law fully implemented than me. The Safe Streets Ordinance is the culmination of several meetings with our Mobility Department, Engineering Department, Department of Public Works, Union Square and East Somerville Main Streets, and local advocacy groups; all in an effort to craft language that was ambitious and feasible with the goal of ending traffic deaths in our community.<br><br>I know where the difficulties lie in its implementation, both fiscally, politically, and physically. For example, our Bicycle Network Plan projected a protected bike lane on a part of Washington St near Cobble Hill that was to be constructed as part of the 90 Washington St project - a street that currently does not exist for a project that is now dead. I understand deeply the type of investment the City will need to make to structurally change our streets. I have also stood before business owners frustrated with the loss of parking and am prepared to deal with the backlash that may come with not being able to please everyone. I will ensure that we prioritize setting aside funding in our capital plan for these projects as well as keep a close eye on construction projects along the routes of the priority network within the Bicycle Network Plan because there is no one in this race more committed to seeing us meet the deadlines set in this ordinance than me.</td>
	<td>Traffic violence is a plague on our community and something I think about every day. Research shows the biggest thing we can do is change the built environment, with safety infrastructure, traffic calming, more trees, better lighting, and – critically – repaving our street surfaces. If drivers and cyclists are looking down at the road for potholes, they aren’t scanning for hazards, and we need to prioritize fixing our street surfaces.<br><br>There’s a major If You Build It, They Will Come approach when it comes to cycling infrastructure. It will always come down to the weakest link of a cycling journey, so it’s critical that we look at our overall bicycle network and address any gaps. We’re obligated to build at least three miles of protected bike lanes per year under the Safe Streets Ordinance, and having a good plan for how we plan to fulfill that requirement is vital.<br><br>I believe in being up front about any loss of parking spots when presenting potential plans to the public. If we believe in what we are doing from a street safety standpoint, we should be able to justify that loss of parking. And any reduction in parking needs to be preceded by extensive work with area businesses and residents to make the parking we’re keeping better serve the area. We have to make sure our parking is smarter, especially if we’re decreasing our parking inventory.<br><br>I’ll also bring increased traffic enforcement to the city. We will increase the amount of traffic enforcement by the Somerville Police Department. We will be ready for the state to legalize automated traffic enforcement by having a plan to do this equitably and a budget for equipment, staff, and a vendor. If legalization of automated traffic enforcement doesn’t happen, we will pursue camera traffic enforcement on our own, as this already is allowed under current Massachusetts General Law.</td>

		<td>Highways and hills physically divide Somerville neighborhoods, disconnecting us from our neighbors and often making it more difficult to navigate the city. The struggles this creates are particularly acute for seniors and folks with mobility needs, specifically when traveling from North-to-South throughout the city. But this doesn’t have to be the case. In the absence of state action through the MBTA, Somerville should follow the example of Salem and create municipal micro-transit routes to fill the gap in service. As a councilor, I’ve proposed applying for federal grants to create micro-transit routes to bring connectivity to our city, prioritizing routes using data we received from our former Taxi-to-Health program. As mayor, I will create a pilot program to gauge the long-term benefits of bringing our neighbors together and toward the resources they need.</td>
	<td>For starters, we need to maintain the bus routes we currently have, pushing back on any attempts to reroute, remove, or reduce the frequency of existing bus routes. I will advocate strongly for increased service and reduced headways on Somerville bus routes.<br><br>I’ll also push for adding a Union Square stop on the Commuter Rail Fitchburg Line, to serve as a Red-Green connector between Porter and Union Squares.<br><br>And I’ll continue my demand for north-south transit in the city. The Somernova development has promised a north-south shuttle as one of the community benefits agreements, but while we’re waiting for that to happen I’ll continue conversations I’ve started with Via, operators of the Salem Skipper, about potentially operating a similar service in Somerville. The MBTA also has expressed interest in providing this service with smaller buses able to navigate our hills, so I’ll look to bring the MBTA to the table as well.</td>

		<td>This is perhaps the issue that impacts our neighbors throughout the city more directly than any other and it is one that is personally painful to me. Every year, I lose friends to other communities that can offer them a home to buy for a semi-reasonable price or rent them an apartment without entirely breaking their banks. Moreover, as someone who has been displaced, I know the stress created in our community from the lack of affordable housing. We need bold action to confront this problem.<br><br>Seven years ago, one year after I was displaced, Mayor Curtatone created the Office of Housing Stability to direct resources and support toward renters experiencing housing instability. It began with a single employee - the Director - whose role was to build the department and set direction for how we could support our neighbors facing displacement. As the only renter in this race and the only candidate who doesn’t take donations from for-profit developers, I know that we must do more to build permanently affordable housing. That is why, as Mayor, I will create an Office of Social Housing with a single Director-level employee whose job will be to determine the legal and financial path to leveraging our municipal land, Housing Acquisition Fund, and partnerships with non-profits like the Community Land Trust to build out a department that can create permanently affordable housing owned by the City. Where the Office of Housing Stability will treat the symptoms of this issue, the Office of Social Housing will get to the root by creating decommodified housing.<br><br>While there are local funding streams we could tap in order to fund this, including potentially the funds that we would gain by enforcing our Vacant Properties Ordinance, certainly state funding would greatly help. I was incredibly happy to support our Commonwealth’s Fair Share amendment. I was far less pleased when the governor essentially reduced overall revenue by lowering the capital gains tax and raising the threshold for the estate tax. Utilizing the skills I’ve honed as a community organizer, I would look to reverse this backlash to our millionaire’s tax. I will note that I did ask our Finance Director to estimate how much revenue the City would gain if we implemented a 3% community impact fee on short-term rentals like AirBnBs. He responded that it would be reasonable to assume $400,000, at least 35% of which would legally be required by the state to go into affordable housing or local infrastructure projects. We have now implemented that community impact fee and, as mayor, I will use a portion of that fee to build our social housing portfolio.</td>
	<td>We can make additional affordable housing pencil out for developers by providing density bonuses for going beyond the 20-percent inclusionary zoning minimum. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) route has worked for some developers, as has the Chapter 40B approach. I want to explore expanded Urban Center Housing-Tax Increment Financing (UCH-TIF) usage elsewhere in the city to realize similar benefits like what we’re about to see with the 299 Broadway project.<br><br>We’ve used direct subsidization from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to make the project financials pencil out, and we’ve also gotten creative with state grants like MassWorks, with Somerville Community Land Trust as partner.<br><br>I will absolutely advocate for the Commonwealth to raise more revenue, especially with the recent lowering of the federal tax burden. Despite its long-time reputation as a state with a high tax burden, Massachusetts currently doesn’t even rank in the Top 10 in tax burden in the United States and we don’t have a truly progressive income tax at the state level. Changing this won’t be quick or easy, but I’ll be a loud voice for doing so.<br><br>My favored approach is to form coalitions of local leaders to put pressure on their state delegations rather than asking Someville's state delegation to lobby colleagues to build support. This is something I’ll look to do as mayor when it comes to legislation at the state level.</td>

<p>A common complaint among builders and contractors working in Somerville is that permitting and inspections are slow and inconsistent. What will you do to simplify our permitting processes and bring them in line with peer cities? Are there other processes or procedures you would improve?

		<td>I certainly have heard this complaint before, compounded by the fact that an unnecessarily long process often costs both homeowners and small businesses more money. On the small business side, I’ve seen what even relatively simple comparative analysis can do to improve our community. In my first few months on the council, I discovered that Somerville was charging tattoo shops far more in fees than our counterparts in Boston, Cambridge, or even Salem. Through effective advocacy, I convinced the Board of Health to suspend these inequitable fees, saving our small businesses thousands of dollars. Similarly, as Chair of the Licenses and Permits Committee, I’ve helped many small business owners struggling to receive the necessary inspections to open their stores get the help they need. But they shouldn’t have to hope someone is looking out for them. That’s why, as Mayor, I will do a comprehensive and comparative review of our City’s licensing fees and work to streamline our permitting process for small business owners and homeowners seeking to make changes to their home. This is part of how we create affordability for all. And, in sticking with that value, I will seek to do this interdepartmental review in-house with the collaboration of neighboring municipalities.</td>
	<td>Somerville ISD's reputation is regional, and it’s not positive. This is one of the most common frustrations I’ve heard from the people of Somerville over the years and especially when knocking doors this year. I’ve experienced frustrations with permitting and inspections myself, so I understand the urgency of the situation all too well.<br><br>We will start by making sure we’re using software that alerts applicants to next steps, and instruct staff to give info on next steps when communicating with applicants. I frequently hear from people who contact ISD to find out what’s happening with a permit only to be told they were supposed to do a previous step. I’m intrigued by the idea of a property owner’s bill of rights, and the shot clock idea is an interesting one. We’ve done similar things with permitting in other areas, like demolition.<br><br>I also like the idea of what Boston has done, where housing developments with 60 percent or greater affordable units go to the front of the line for permitting. This could be an interesting policy for us to trial in Somerville.</td>

		<td>This is an incredibly important issue in terms of ensuring city services are properly implemented. Firstly, as a former union member, I would not slow union negotiations to the point our workers are out of contract for years. The delay of the SMEU contract caused people to not apply to work for the City, to drop out of the hiring process, and workers who live in the city - whose families I spoke to - to consider quitting. Secondly, I would continue work that I have already begun on the council to expand worker benefits. In 2022, at the tail-end of my first year on the council, I brought a series of orders to the council that would investigate whether our City could afford to be the first municipality to opt into the state’s Paid Family and Medical Leave program, which would have drastically increased this form of leave for our employees. For over a year, the administration delayed answering straightforward questions on the matter and would not even tell me if this was something that our workers wanted, instead arguing that our benefits were already superior to the 12-weeks that the state required (despite the benefits for nonunion workers being 2-weeks). Over two years later, in 2025, the administration announced that we would be doing a municipal version of the state’s program with 8-weeks of leave. This would not have happened had I not consistently and relentlessly pushed for better benefits for our employees amidst our vacancy crisis.<br><br>Let’s be clear: as a small city, our public sector jobs are not likely to match the salaries of the same jobs in the private sector. What we can do is provide better benefits, flexibility, and stability for our workers. As mayor, that is what I will do. Despite taking some of my ideas around expanding benefits, the current administration has not taken them all. As mayor, I will require that leave for survivors of abuse be granted paid leave - rather than the unpaid leave the City currently offers - as I proposed over two years ago. No one should lose money because they are assaulted.<br><br>In terms of monitoring performance, I will monitor closely the data coming out of our different departments - how long does it take for businesses and buildings to receive the necessary inspections and can we implement “shot clock” deadlines, how many of our families choose to send their children to private school rather than our public schools, are we implementing Sentinel Event Reviews after crises of public safety - and I will implement strategies to improve outcomes. There are many different metrics to ensure that we are improving our systems, but what matters is that we are synthesizing the data with intention. SomerSTAT will be an important department for that high-level work.</td>
	<td>The staffing shortage is real and has been exacerbated by the long wait for new contracts. SMEU Unit B – the City’s largest municipal union – recently had went over 2.5 years without a contract, receiving meager 1-percent automatic cost of living adjustments each year, while we experienced extremely high inflation. As a result, we lost so many talented workers, and in really crucial roles. Remaining staff have had to do the work of two or even three or more people, and it definitely has impacted our ability to provide some programs and services.<br><br>The new contract for SMEU Unit B is, by the account of union leadership, a very good one. From conversations with department heads, it’s already helping with rebuilding our depleted municipal workforce. One of the core parts of my campaign platform is prioritizing that process with an aggressive push from Human Resources to fill vacant positions. Employee recruitment and retention are critical to organizations and I want to attract and keep good people.<br><br>The City has an entire department (SomerStat) dedicated to gathering data that can be used to evaluate performance. As a lover of meaningful data – especially to inform decision making – I’m very excited to unleash the full power of SomerStat to make sure my administration is operating with quality data to inform our decisions and policies.</td>

<h2><a name="Q11"></a>Question 11</h2>
<p>The city’s independent advisory boards, especially the Zoning Board of Appeals, Planning Board, Urban Design Commission, and Historic Preservation Commission, can significantly impede or accelerate construction in the city. Many of these boards have empty seats, or seats filled by members whose terms have expired. The city’s upcoming new charter will also require a review and re-evaluation of all multi-member boards.
<br><br>
How will you manage the review of and appointments to these boards? Will you commit to promptly filling vacant seats with members who will support the creation of new housing?

		<td>As mayor, I will expeditiously fill vacancies across boards and commissions. Frankly, this has been one of my frustrations with the current administration. After taking roughly a year and a half to return the charter to the council for a final vote, I was infuriated to see that the mayor had increased the length of time she is allowed to make appointments for vacant seats on boards and commissions. This is an example of us moving backwards as a City - we should be streamlining our processes and moving to quickly fill vacancies of all kinds, not slow them down further.<br><br>I will work to increase awareness of boards and commissions, through additional advertisements, empowering them to fully meet their missions, and integrating them into our Civics Days as well as other City programming.</td>
	<td>As a City Councilor-At-Large I have served on the Confirmation of Appointments and Personnel Matters Committee and took my responsibility to interview appointees to multi-member bodies extremely seriously. These bodies play an extremely important role in the city and it’s critical that we fill vacant seats. For a while I maintained my own spreadsheet of all the slots on all of the City’s multi-member bodies. Now an employee in the City Clerk’s office maintains their own official database. I think this information should be shared with the public.<br><br>We rely on community members stepping up and serving on these bodies for little or often no compensation. So we need to make sure we’re advertising vacancies and conducting a productive and respectful evaluation process for folks who express interest. I’ve heard too many stories of constituents putting their hand up to serve on a board or commission, only to wait to hear back, interview, and then for final word on whether they’re being appointed. We need to do better and my administration will do better.<br><br>I view expired terms and lengthy vacancies on multi-member bodies as failures and I absolutely will prioritize preventing these situations from occurring. When we do have the opportunity to appoint or reappoint, we will make sure applicants have appropriate approaches to the subject matter they’ll be dealing with. If they’re applying to serve on a body making decisions about development or housing, then it’s important that they understand the housing and displacement crises that we’re in and are committed to helping address that meaningfully in the role.</td>

<h2><a name="Q12"></a>Question 12</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/16/business/housing-poll-voters/">Recent polling suggests that a majority of Massachusetts voters support new housing</a> development, favoring it over other considerations like preserving the character of neighborhoods. Do you agree? Why or why not?</p>

		<td>I do agree. We are in a housing crisis and we need to start acting like it. That does not mean we should not consider the ripple effects of the construction of large amounts of luxury housing in our neighborhoods on the cost of surrounding housing, traffic, and our infrastructure. However, the idea that we can preserve our community in amber while stopping the large-scale displacement of our neighbors is patently absurd.</td>
	<td>It’s clear that the large numbers of people moving out of Massachusetts isn’t due to jobs or our tax scheme. It’s due to the price of housing here. Yes, this is an issue nationally, but we feel it particularly acutely in the region. I’m encouraged by recent movement at the state level with the MBTA Communities Act and the legal backing of its requirements, the Governor’s Affordable Homes Act, and other budgets and legislation that show we’re finally starting to get serious about the need to address housing in Massachusetts.<br><br>People, businesses, and arts make the neighborhood what it is much more so than structures. So figuring out how to do the commercial and residential development Somerville needs while preventing displacement of residents, local business, and artists is the key challenge facing us, and one that I’ll relish taking on as mayor.<br><br>Somerville prides itself on being a welcoming community for immigrants and refugees. But with the state’s family shelter system teetering on the bring, it’s one thing to say you’re welcoming and quite another to actually make it possible for people to live in your community. With wars in Gaza and Ukraine and civil wars elsewhere, there’s a moral argument for building additional housing to accommodate refugees.</td>

		<td>I would just note that I believe, like the vast majority of Somerville, that we need to build more housing. But I do think it is foolhardy to believe that, on its own, the market will solve the issue of unaffordability that it created. The mass acquisition of housing and even trailer parks that corporations have been involved in is proof enough of that. That’s why I think it is critical that the public sector be involved in the acquisition and development of housing, as well. Obviously the federal and state governments have far more means than Somerville to do this and, as mayor, I would speak with my counterparts at those levels to push for additional resources. However, where the state and federal government fail us, I believe it is incumbent upon local government to step up with the means that we have. It won’t be easy and it won’t happen overnight. But, as the paraphrased adage goes: the best time to build a home is twenty years ago, the second best is today. This is why we need an Office of Social Housing.</td>
	<td>I’m a big fan of co-housing and would love to see Somerville get some of this built here. It’s a great antidote to the proverbial coalition of roommates that takes up a three- or four-bedroom unit that otherwise would be inhabited by a family. Co-housing has proven extremely popular in other cities and it would be a big hit in Somerville.<br><br>The lack of family-sized units also could be addressed by allowing developers to satisfy the 20-percent inclusionary zoning requirement by floor area ratio or unit count. I understand that other cities are looking at reducing inclusionary zoning requirements, but I don’t see any appetite in Somerville for doing that here.<br><br>I continue to be intrigued by Type IV mass timber construction and I want to make sure Somerville is prepared for our first mass timber construction project. I also want to put this idea in developers’ heads so they’re not ruling out buildings between seven and 11 stories tall.<br><br>I know Somerville YIMBY previously discussed the idea of weighing in on overdose prevention centers. I’d encourage you to get behind engagement centers with wraparound services in both East Somerville and Davis Square. There are significant homeless populations in both areas of the city who would benefit greatly from having something to do during the day, as well as accessing services and having heating and cooling centers available at all times of day.<br><br>Somerville needs to increase our shelter capacity as a short-term response to the increased homelessness. An expended shelter is being held up by a legal challenge, and having Somerville YIMBY back these shelter project could help.<br><br>Ultimately, the solution to homelessness is permanent supportive housing. Somerville has lagged behind our neighbors, but there’s now an interest on the part of community development partners to build more. Backing this approach is a good opportunity for Somerville YIMBY to help meaningfully address homelessness.</td>
