	<li><p><strong>Joe Lynch:</strong>&nbsp;Good
	evening everyone. I'm Joe Lynch, president of the Somerville Media
	Center board of directors. Welcome to the 2025 Somerville Municipal
	Election Debates. These candidates will appear on the November 4th
	general election ballot. The debates are being brought to you by the
	Somerville Media Center and the Somerville Beacon with generous
	support from the Somerville Theater and the Crystal Ballroom
	organizations. Our sincere thanks to Ian Judge and his colleagues
	for their community spirit and partnership with us. Tonight, we hope
	to provide to you insight regarding your choices for mayor with very
	lively debate. Perhaps you'll go away with some clear answers to
	questions like, &quot;What makes this candidate different from their
	opponent? How will they govern? Will they prove to be true to their
	campaign promises? And will they listen to me and my concerns? Will
	they have will they make hard and timely decisions for the benefit
	of all? Have I met them? Do I like them? And most importantly, will
	they continue to serve pizza at community meetings?&quot; Our
	moderator for the mayoral debate is Ben Orenstein. A resident of
	Somerville, Ben currently resides in the Magoun Square district. He
	is a tech entrepreneur and the founder of the online site, the
	Somerville Beacon. Our moderator has spent many hours watching
	almost all of the recordings of the town hall forums and community
	meetings, reading the Q&amp;As from each candidate and the
	questionnaires from various local groups. He has also solicited
	questions from the general public in preparation for tonight. The
	moderator has not shared the questions with anyone before tonight,
	and I mean anyone. I should know, I've asked him. Let's sit back.
	Let's get comfortable. Pay attention. Take notes if you have to,
	although I have it on very good authority from the executive
	director of the media center, Sean Effel, that tonight's recording
	will be available by 5:00 p.m. tomorrow. Let's let's also remember
	one thing. Let's be respectful of each other. That's what all of us
	should expect from each other. This is the candidates' night. Some
	of you may have already cast your early mail-in ballot and the
	remainder will have your say on or before November 4th. My friends,
	please welcome the 2025 city of Somerville mayoral candidates and
	their debate moderator, Ben Orenstein.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Ben Orenstein (Moderator):</strong>&nbsp;Good evening
	everyone, and welcome to the mayoral portion of this debate. My name
	is Ben Orenstein and I'm honored to be moderating tonight's
	conversation. Thank you to the Somerville Media Center for
	co-hosting this event. And thank you to all of you for being here
	and participating actively in self-government. Tonight, you will
	hear from Jake Wilson and Willie Burnley Jr., both of whom have
	served our city as city councilors at large and are now asking for
	your vote to become Somerville's next mayor. Tonight's debate will
	start with 2-minute opening statements. First from Councilor Wilson
	and then from Councilor Burnley. Then we'll move into our main Q&amp;A
	segment with approximately 8 questions sourced from our community
	and edited by me. For each question, the candidates will have 90
	seconds to answer. After that, each candidate may choose to offer a
	30 second rebuttal if they wish. If a candidate&nbsp;<em><i>does</i></em>&nbsp;use
	their rebuttal time, I'll ask them to respond directly to what was
	just said and not introduce new material. The speaking order will
	alternate with each question so both candidates have equal
	opportunity to speak first and last. After our main Q&amp;A, we will
	do something a slightly different, a rapid-fire round where I will
	ask yes/no questions and the candidates will respond by holding up
	signs that you've seen, rather than speaking. We will end with
	2-minute closing statements. This time, Councilor Burnley will go
	first and Councilor Wilson will go last. To our candidates,
	gentlemen, thank you for putting yourselves forward for this
	difficult job and thank you for rising to the challenge of a live
	debate. What you're doing tonight is not easy, but it does matter.
	Councilor Wilson, your opening statement, please.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="opening"></a>Opening statements</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Jake Wilson</strong>:
	Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Ben, thank you to the Media Center,
	thank you to Somerville Beacon, and thank you everyone here, for
	coming out, for showing an interest in this. I'm really excited to
	be here. I'm really proud of the campaign that we've built here over
	the last 10 months. Since December 16th, we've been doing the work.
	We've been out there talking to people, going to events, listening,
	sharing our vision for how to take the city forward. We're coming in
	here tonight with a lot of momentum. You've probably seen it. We've
	racked up a lot of endorsements from electeds, a lot on the labor
	side, and in the past week from the Boston Globe and the Somerville
	Dems. Really happy to be on the stage here with someone who I
	respect a lot, someone I consider a friend. Since our first
	conversation about what we're potentially getting into here, at that
	time we committed to running a positive issue-focused race and I
	feel like we've done that so far. And I'm excited to to see that
	continue tonight and going forward. This is a pivotal moment in our
	city. We're facing crises on a number of fronts: affordability, safe
	streets, city services in decline, rodents, homelessness, substance
	abuse, disorder. We need a mayor who's able to lead and manage
	effectively. Good operations are an absolute requirement to make
	sure that we can realize our policy objectives. Both of us have some
	lofty goals. We need the staffing and the operation in place to get
	those done. We have to be able to collaborate in order to see the
	change that we want. I'll be a mayor who's going to be able to
	implement my policy plans and get results for Somerville. I'm
	excited to be here, eager to talk about a number of big issues that
	I expect are going to come up and and I welcome the questions. So,
	let's jump in.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Councilor
	Burnley.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Willie Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you, Ben. Thank you to the media center and also to the Crystal
	Ballroom for hosting us tonight. And hello, Somerville. Hi. My name
	is Willie Burnley Jr. I am a renter living on Winter Hill near
	Magoun Square, your at-large City Councilor, and I am running to be
	your next mayor because I believe that we have the collective
	expertise in this community and the collective passion in making
	this place a home for everyone. And because of that we can make
	Somerville more affordable, accessible, and accountable to
	everybody. This is not just an election like any other. And frankly,
	I'm not a candidate like any other. I know that for some people I
	don't look like the typical mayoral candidate and I'm not the pick
	of the political establishment, but these are not typical times that
	we live in. Our democracy is under attack from the federal level all
	the way down to the local level, and most of our neighbors are
	struggling just to stay in their homes. This is not the time to pick
	a new mayor who's going to tweak around the edges or who's going to
	offer incremental change while our neighbors are going through
	crisis. We need someone who is going to fundamentally challenge a
	status quo that is not working for working people, and I believe
	that I have the lived and professional experience to do that. Over
	the next hour, we're going to answer some questions. Many of you in
	the crowd will probably be using that opportunity to try to figure
	out what makes these two guys different here. Joe asked the question
	earlier and I'm going to try to give you a really quick split screen
	of that. In 2021, when both of us ran for City Council, we both took
	a number of pledges-</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Councilor,
	I'm afraid that's time.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Okay,
	there we go. Well, I'll get to it soon.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. Plenty of time to talk
	a little bit more.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Q1"></a>Question
1: housing shortage/production</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Let's
	start with our first question. This is on housing. First, Councilor
	Wilson, please.&nbsp;<strong>In 2019, Somerville declared legally a
	rental housing emergency due to a lack of supply. It was voted 10-1
	in the council, signed into law by the mayor, and it remains in
	effect today, but average rents have risen since then. How will you
	use your office to increase housing production and end the emergency
	shortage?</strong></p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah,
	thanks for that question. And since then, we've also seen the Green
	Line come into Somerville. So, it's a real opportunity here with
	with a number of new transit stations in the city. And I think
	that's key. We need to be taking advantage of the land around those
	transit stations and aggressively up-zoning there to make sure that
	that we're able to add that density where people are looking for it
	which is right there at the transit stations. It's a clear
	opportunity and I serve on the Land Use committee and I'm excited
	that right now we are doing exactly that. We're taking up in
	meetings right now up-zoning around Gilman Square, looking to make
	Gilman Square happen. That's an opportunity of an area that isn't
	really on the map at this point. And we want to make sure that with
	that T station coming in that we're able to put the kind of
	development in there, mixed-use development, dense buildings with
	lots of housing in there and make sure that we're able to to meet
	that. I look at the development set to break ground at the former
	Star Market site 299 Broadway. I serve on the Winter Hill Civic
	Advisory Committee. I know the tools that we use to unlock a really
	good development going in there that's going to be&nbsp;<em><i>way</i></em>&nbsp;north
	of the minimum 20%. We need to use those same tools elsewhere in the
	city. We're building the kind of housing we need because we're never
	going to reach our goals of 20% affordable citywide if each project
	we do is just that minimum 20%. So between that, and I'm running out
	of time here, but I'll throw in a shout out for social housing as
	well. It's worked really well in other cities such as Vienna. We
	need to figure out how to do that here in Somerville.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. Councilor?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. As a renter in this race and someone who, like my colleague in
	2021, agreed to not take money from for-profit developers, I think
	that this is one of our most critical issues and it's something I've
	been very consistent on since I was elected. I have passed laws that
	expand tenants rights for residents. I've helped enforce broker fees
	at the state level so that renters don't have to pay thousands of
	dollars for a broker they never hired. And I've also passed zoning
	changes that actually bring down the cost of housing construction by
	removing unnecessary mandates for those developers. These are real,
	actionable steps toward the overarching fight of our lives, which is
	to make Somerville home for everyone. But there is more that a mayor
	can do, and we need someone who is bold and willing to make tough
	decisions in order to get there. I'm the only candidate who's said
	that in my first term I will establish an office of social housing
	to create permanently affordable housing on municipal land. We were
	just talking about Gilman Square: there is a shack that is blighted,
	right behind the old Mad Oyster Arts Building. It is a municipal
	building. The biggest lot in that area is a municipal lot. It takes
	the city's leadership and we need a mayor who's going to step up on
	that front. I am going to do that if I have the honor to earn your
	vote tonight. Thank you.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Would
	you like a rebuttal, Councilor?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;All
	good.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;I
	would just note- do I get a rebuttal? Or can I- how's that work?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;I
	don't know if you can rebut yourself!</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Why
	not? I'm a great-</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;It's
	not just 30 seconds more to speak, but it's intended to be a
	response to the thing you just heard from your your colleague.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Oh
	yeah.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;So,
	let's move on to the next question.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Oh,
	fine.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;We keep it moving.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Q2"></a>Question
2: reduced city revenue/potential budget cuts</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;This
	next question is about the city budget.&nbsp;<strong>Revenue from
	new construction has dropped 49% in 2 years here. Property taxes are
	constrained by Proposition 2 1/2 and ARPA funds are exhausted.
	Healthcare costs just had record increases, and we have also
	massively increased spending on schools. Imagine that next year
	requires you to cut 10% of the city budget, which would be about $35
	million. What specifically gets cut first? Please name departments,
	programs, or positions.</strong>&nbsp;Councilor Burnley, you're
	first this time.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. I think this question actually looks at this in a very wrong
	way, frankly. And I'll say that this is not the moment where we need
	to be ushering in local austerity when we have a federal government
	that is trying to weaponize our grants to force our community to
	cooperate with ICE and that's trying to withhold funding from
	sanctuary cities. The money is there. We absolutely have the money
	in this state in order to unleash the potential of Somerville. I
	mean, we just fought a few years ago for a millionaire's tax, that
	at the state level has been undermined time and time again by
	giveaways to the ultra wealthy, by raising the cap on the estate
	tax, by a capital gains cut for the ultra wealthy. I will be an
	advocate at the state and federal level to make sure that Somerville
	is getting the funding that we need for programs like Head Start,
	that serves low-income students and children in this city, for
	programs like my Office of Social Housing, which we can fund using
	the 3% community impact fee on AirBnBs that I fought for as a part
	of the Creative Displacement Task Force. The money is there; it
	takes the political will to actually use it. And that's the kind of
	clear, focused commitment I'm willing to give. Thank you.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah,
	appreciate this question. From having chaired the finance committee
	all four years on the council, I'm all too familiar with the with
	the city budget. Yeah, we're facing a really tough fiscal situation
	potentially here this summer, between possible loss of $19.5 million
	in federal funds as well as just the slowdown that was mentioned.
	There will be some tough choices to be made. I don't view it as
	eliminating departments or slashing departments, I think it has to
	be looked at operationally in terms of- to give an example, in the
	FY24 budget there was a move to add a number of sort of middle
	management, deputy director, finance analyst jobs, and maybe we find
	a way to consolidate some of that if we do end up needing to to do a
	reduction in in headcount. You know hopefully that can be avoided.
	We have we do have rainy day funds, we have them for a reason.
	Between the loss of federal funding and the economic situation, you
	know, you ask yourself, is this one of those rainy day situations
	where we do need to tap into some of those stabilization funds? But
	yeah, I'm reluctant to mention any specific positions, I don't want
	anyone coming away from this thinking that their position is under
	threat. There will be tough decisions that have to be made. I'm
	unafraid to make those tough decisions and make sure that the budget
	we come out with here in FY27 is going to be a budget that reflects
	our values. Thank you.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Would
	you like a rebuttal, sir?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;No,
	thank you.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, great. We speedy.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Q3"></a>Question
3: #1 goal for first term</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Councilor
	Wilson, we'll start with you this time.&nbsp;<strong>If you were
	limited to accomplishing only one thing in your first term, what
	would you choose?</strong></p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;I
	just get one. I won't limit it to opening the mayor's office door
	and unlocking it. That's an easy one. I will say, biggest thing for
	me that we want to focus on is staffing up. Making sure that we are
	at a level in terms of vacancies that actually allows us to
	accomplish our policy goals. Because if you don't have the staff to
	do it, good luck. You know, you can have the most ambitious goals
	out there, you can even have very realistic goals and
	you're&nbsp;<em><i>not</i></em>&nbsp;going to achieve them if you
	don't have the staff working for the city to go do that work. And
	we've had a huge vacancy rate in the last budget. DPW for example,
	one in five jobs was vacant in DPW. 40% of the grounds division is
	vacant. When people ask me, you know, why do we struggle to maintain
	our squares and our parks and why is there trash? Grounds division
	with 40% vacancies, they're working 6-day weeks. You know, they're
	out there covering for two or three colleagues. We have to make sure
	that we are staffed up. That starts with really good recruitment and
	retention. The average person in Somerville doesn't realize how
	understaffed we are. From knocking the number of doors that I've
	knocked, coming up on 10,000, I can't tell you how many times people
	are shocked to hear about those vacancy numbers. We have to make
	sure people know that their city is hiring, and we have to make sure
	Somerville is an employer of choice in the region and people want to
	come work for this city again, and then we have to do that hiring.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Can
	I go? Okay, thank you. I agree. I think that we absolutely need to
	be filling our vacancies, but if I had to put it in a word, I would
	say implementation. Somerville has a lot of great plans. Somerville
	residents are experts in so many different fields from architecture
	to urban planning to environmental science, but we actually need to
	put those plans into motion. Part of that is hiring, of course, part
	of that is prioritization. And part of that is making sure that our
	workers actually feel welcomed in this city. We've had multiple
	contract negotiations in the last few years, and each one of them
	has been very painful for our staff. I've tried as a Councilor to
	always support our local unions. When we got a request from the
	Somerville Municipal Employees Union, which is the same group of
	people that Councilor Wilson was just talking about, the
	groundskeepers, DPW, ISD. They asked us to take a hard vote to
	freeze the mayor's executive staff salary increase so that they
	could have a stronger negotiating hand. I worked with that union and
	I voted in favor of it. My colleague did not. I actually want to be
	a mayor who makes the workers feel like their lives have dignity and
	that they can afford to live in the community that they serve.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Rebuttal?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;I'll
	take that. Yeah. Referring to that vote that was taken, there was an
	approach that a colleague brought. I had an alternative approach. I
	spoke to union leadership about it. They were okay with whatever
	came out of that. Unfortunately, some chaos was introduced right in
	between there. If you go watch the video, you see I go to make my
	cut after the initial cut failed, and a colleague jumped in with a
	very different cut of the CAO position that honestly was not really-
	it impacted the numbers that we could have done with that and then
	the council ended up voting to cut the CAO position. So, um-</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;That's
	time. Thank you. Would you like to respond?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. Just really briefly, it
	is not my impression that the union was fine with whatever. The
	union came to us specifically with a demand to say, use your
	leverage as a City Councilor to support the workers of this city. We
	want to make sure that the mayor knows that if we don't get a raise,
	her people shouldn't get a raise either. I said, I think that is
	reasonable. I think that is fair. And I'm always going to support
	workers when it comes to making sure that our city can function and
	that they have dignity. We had a difference of opinion. Thank you.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Q4"></a>Question
4: what would you do differently from Ballantyne</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;This
	next question will start with Councilor Burnley.&nbsp;<strong>Mayor
	Ballantyne received only 23% of the vote in the preliminary
	election, which is rare for an incumbent mayor in Massachusetts.
	What is the single biggest policy decision from the Ballantyne
	administration that you would reverse? And what would you do
	instead?</strong></p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Again,
	implementation. I used to have these lawn signs, some of you in this
	room might have them, that said fewer studies, more action. And when
	I talk to people about their frustration with city government in
	recent years, it has been about the fact that it has felt like we've
	been in a limbo since Joe, not that Joe [Lynch], the other Joe
	[Curtatone]. And we absolutely should be leading the way. We're
	Somerville. We are one of the most progressive communities in the
	state, bar none. We should have leadership that actually acts on
	those values. That's what I've done on the city council, passing
	more laws than any other of my colleagues, expanding tenants'
	rights, expanding rights for workers, taking on fights that
	Councilors can't even take on directly, trying to use ARPA funding
	to abolish medical debt. As I mentioned before, successfully helping
	enforce broker fees across the states. Cutting inequitable
	permitting fees for small businesses that now have saved thousands
	of dollars because they had one Councilor in the last four years who
	said, &quot;Let me actually look at what we're charging our small
	businesses and see if we can make it more fair for them as compared
	to Boston and Cambridge or Medford.&quot;&nbsp;<em><i>These</i></em>&nbsp;are
	the actions that I wish the mayor had taken. As a Councilor, I tried
	to take up as many of them as I could, but if I am able to be
	elected mayor, I will certainly have the resources and staffing to
	do more.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. Councilor?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah,
	it's a really good question. One we get asked a lot, you know, in a
	race where people struggled, when there were 3 of us, people
	struggled to to sort of differentiate policy-wise. And it was
	pointed out many times on policy, you know, there was often a lot of
	overlap, but the distinctions were really oftentimes on approach, on
	priority, and on style, a lot of times. Similar to what my colleague
	just said- I'm trying to think of like a single policy. I mean
	obviously there were policies we disagreed with, but in terms of
	something that we'd flip, honestly, the biggest thing is just going
	to be where the focus is, with a focus on making decisions. That's
	been a real source of frustration for people. It's one of the
	reasons why we're going to have a new mayor come January.
	Approachability, making sure that people know that their mayor is
	out there, wants to talk to them, wants to hear from them, is open
	to that feedback, and just and cares about hearing what people are
	going through, what you know, what business owners are going
	through, what workers in the city are going through, and wanting to
	make sure that that the people feel heard and listened to because
	when the people don't feel heard, they're going to make themselves
	feel heard, and you're generally not going to like how that goes.
	And that's what happened on September 16th was the voters of
	Somerville made themselves heard about the approach the mayor had
	taken to the position and here we are.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Rebuttal,
	sir?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley</strong>:
	Certainly. On the topic of voters feeling heard. Our election is not
	the only election or vote on the ballot. There's at-large races that
	are going on, as the folks in this room know. There are also a
	number of ballot initiatives that are coming up. One of the things
	that I mentioned and have fought for is the right for voters to
	actually have a say on Question 3, about divestment. My colleague
	has said if that question passes, he will not implement it. I will.
	I think you listen to people, and then you act.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Councilor
	Wilson?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;On
	the subject of ballot questions, I'll take the opportunity to to
	stump for Question 1. That is the new charter for the city. So much
	work has gone into that. Five years of work, first from the charter
	review committee in the community, with some elected representation,
	and then the City Council for years, eventually working with the
	mayor. The State House approved it, Governor Healey signed it, it's
	now before the voters. I'm urging everyone to vote yes on Question 1
	to make sure we get a good, modern charter that the city deserves.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Just a quick reminder, I
	urge you to resist the temptation to introduce new topics in the
	rebuttals, try to keep the rebuttal responding to the last thing
	that was said if possible. Thank you.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Q5"></a>Question
5: Davis Square</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Let's
	begin with Councilor Wilson.&nbsp;<strong>There is significant
	frustration in Somerville right now about the current state of Davis
	Square and 7 Hills Park. Many residents feel these areas are no
	longer safe as they are frequented by people who are homeless,
	struggling with addiction issues, or mentally ill. Do you agree
	there is a problem in those areas that must be resolved? If so, how
	will you use the powers of the mayorship to address them?</strong></p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
	I appreciate you asking about this. This is a&nbsp;<em><i>huge</i></em>&nbsp;issue
	in the community and I think has been a factor in the campaign in
	terms of what happened on September 16th as well. Oftentimes people
	conflate homelessness and substance abuse disorder. These are
	separate but you know sometimes intersecting issues. When we look at
	what's happening in Davis, you know, we we see these dual crises
	playing out. We need plans to deal with both of them. I like the
	framing that we have to come at this from looking at it as both with
	compassion and with accountability. Making sure that we never lose
	our humanity, and realize these are these are people dealing with
	just an absolutely hellish situation while at the same time making
	sure that that we're clear that there's a baseline level of conduct
	that we're going to accept in the community, from people who are
	housed and people who are unhoused. And it's okay to have
	expectations of people, it's good, in fact. In terms of what we do
	about it, we've got to make sure that we have short-term solutions
	in place. That includes opening the shelter that should have been
	opened a year ago that's been relocated and expanded in Davis
	Square. Medium-term, we have to build more permanent supportive
	housing that, you know, that's a roof over someone's head with the
	wraparound services to give them a chance to succeed. Long-term, we
	have to make sure we get Long Island back reopened. It's been 10
	years since that bridge was was declared unsafe and closed and we've
	really felt the impact of that. I'm going to collaborate with our
	regional partners in other cities to make sure that we're addressing
	a regional crisis with regional solutions.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Councilor?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. Yes, of course there's a problem and for the folks who are
	sleeping on our streets, for the folks who find needles on the
	ground, there is a public safety and a public health crisis
	unfolding. Now, the city has the opportunity to move with more
	urgency on this front, and that's certainly what I would do as
	mayor, both with short-term and long-term solutions. I believe
	there's financial authorities that the city has not used to their
	maximum potential in order to serve these residents. Including the
	fact that Somerville, as a city, we have zero beds for these folks.
	As a city ourselves, we have zero beds. Cambridge has about 60. We
	can do more as a community in order to serve these folks to get them
	off the streets. And we can do more than just have shelter beds. We
	can have transitional and supportive housing. This is something I'm
	very passionate about. What I would not do is say that we're going
	to sweep away people's property and take it away from them, because
	we know the dangers that that presents to all those individuals. My
	colleague again on August 1st in one of his newsletters kept himself
	open to removing people's property, to doing sweeps. I'm not in
	favor of sweeps. I don't think they help, I don't think they're
	going to solve this crisis. I think that we need to approach this
	from a public health and public safety standpoints and ensure that
	people are not forced to live on the streets.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Would
	you like to respond?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;I'm good.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Q6"></a>Question
6: tradeoffs/competing constituencies</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
	Councilor Burnley.&nbsp;<strong>The city faces competing demands.
	Building enough housing versus neighborhood character, bike
	infrastructure versus parking, services versus taxes. Please name
	one constituency that will be disappointed by your administration,
	and why their disappointment is worth it.</strong></p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah,
	absolutely. Absolutely. My friends in the development community will
	be disappointed. Some of them are here actually and we've been you
	know very friendly to each each other. We've gotten drinks, we've
	talked and they know I'm not going to accept their donations. The
	folks who are doing very well for themselves, who feel as though
	Somerville is fine and there's no real problems going on because
	they're in their own bubble? They might be disappointed too, because
	I do believe there there needs to be transformative change in order
	to ensure that the residents of this city, who've made it this
	creative, artistic, compassionate place, are able to actually stay
	in Somerville. You know, the folks who donate to my campaign are
	renters, are people who are on the brink of displacement. They are
	asking themselves every single year whether they'll be able to stay
	here. I don't get many large donations. I'm on a stage with a
	moderator who donated to my opponent, hundreds of dollars, and yet
	I'm here because I believe that we need to have a transparent
	discussion about the issues. And I'm going to fight for the working
	people of this city to ensure that they actually can continue to
	call this place home and that we have economic diversity as well as
	cultural diversity in Somerville.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;I'm
	going to take a rebuttal there.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Please,
	please.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;That
	is true, and then I immediately asked him to refund it, which you
	did. Confirmed?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Confirmed.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. Would you like to respond? Your first answer, sorry. Not a
	rebuttal.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
	Group that's going to be disappointed, I would say owners of surface
	parking lots will be disappointed. We have to do&nbsp;<em><i>way</i></em>&nbsp;better
	with our land. You know, we're here in Davis Square. How many
	surface parking lots do we have around here? I can't think of a
	worse use of land. We're set to introduce a storm water surcharge
	fee. That is going to see those surface parking lots. Especially,
	you know, if they're attached to a store, for example. I got bad
	news for Target: your water bill is about to go way up. I think it's
	fair though, when we're talking about the work we have to do to pay
	to do right by our waterways and make sure they're not flooded with
	untreated or even raw sewage in some cases. These impervious surface
	parking lots are a huge contributor to that. And that's why I think
	it is entirely fair to ask these folks to pay a bigger share of the
	really expensive work required to fulfill our our legal and moral
	obligations to keep sewage out of our waterways and modernize our
	sewer system. Those things are expensive. If your water and sewer
	bills have gone up, it's because we're paying for that work. And I
	think this is a very good way to ask the folks to shoulder the
	burden financially for a problem that they're really contributing to
	more so than your average home in Somerville.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Rebuttal?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
	Just to that point, I totally agree with my colleague on that. And
	to the point about service parking lots and a storm water fee, for
	those folks who maintain those properties, we as Councilors got that
	information after the city went through a years-long consultancy
	with an organization that we paid at least $100,000. And then they
	came back to us years later and said, &quot;Oh, we can't do the
	thing that you asked us to do.&quot; Under my administration, less
	consultants.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Rebuttal?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;I don't know if it's a
	rebuttal, but yeah, to Councilor Burnley's point, yeah, that was one
	of the more frustrating things on the council was hearing that
	there's ratepayer assistance coming and it went on, you know, I
	think over a year of hearing this, only to find out, oh, it's not
	allowed under Mass General Law. Yeah, that was- to the point about,
	you know, studies, that was a particularly frustrating study.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Q7"></a>Question
7: ballot Question 3 (on divestment)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Councilor
	Wilson.&nbsp;<strong>Ballot Question 3 asks, &quot;Shall the mayor
	and all elected leaders be instructed to end city business and
	prohibit future investments and contracts with companies that engage
	in business sustaining Israel's apartheid, genocide, and illegal
	occupation of Palestine?&quot; How will you vote on this issue and
	why? And if adopted, what changes will occur in your administration?</strong></p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah,
	I mean the ballot question came from the community, from folks who
	have seen what's happening over in Gaza and were compelled to go do
	something about it. It's the think globally, act locally approach
	and yeah, we all see what's happening over there. It's an atrocity.
	And I think it's commendable that people want to do something to
	impact that, and in particular that they want to make sure that- I
	understand wanting to make sure tax dollars are not going to fund
	something like that. Where it gets tricky is what we can do under
	the law. You know, chapter 30b is very prescriptive at the state
	level in terms of the public procurement process. I know there's
	been an interest also in then exploring on the divestment side.
	Chapter 30 would govern the boycott part of BDS. On the investment
	side, our neighbors in Medford recently passed an ordinance that
	takes sort of a broader ethical investment approach. Their mayor
	vetoed it, and their law department came in with an opinion that it
	was illegal and would lead to successful lawsuits against them as
	well. I understand people want to explore that. The timing of that,
	obviously, it would focus attention on on Israel specifically, but
	the goal was a broader broader divestment approach. These things
	might be best pursued at the state level. Given the fact that the
	central asks of this are not allowed under the law, I can't support
	it as written, I'm going to be voting no on it.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. Councilor?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;I
	will be voting yes. I absolutely am so impressed and excited by all
	the energy from our residents around this question. Over 8,000
	certified signatures have been given to the elections department.
	Over 11,000 were submitted. That would be about- that's more than
	one in eight people in this city. I actually believe in democracy
	and I believe if the people of our community say that they want
	their tax dollars not to go or be invested in companies like-
	whether it's Caterpillar or a company that drops bombs, creates F35s
	and drops bombs on schools in Gaza- I believe that they have the
	right to demand that of their leaders, and that if it passes, their
	leaders should actually implement it. Medford gave us the model. We
	can absolutely do this. I know as a City Councilor that city
	solicitors almost always kind of side with the mayor and whatever
	the mayor wants to actually happen. It is not a realistic argument
	to say, well, the city solicitor said we can't do it. We absolutely
	can do it. Other communities have done it and we should actually be
	leading on this conversation as the first city in the state that
	passed a ceasefire resolution. It was hundreds of residents that
	came out demanding that, and it was hundreds, it's thousands that
	are demanding this.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Councilor
	Wilson, rebuttal?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;I'm all good.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Q8"></a>Question
8: city department to overhaul</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
	Councilor Burnley,&nbsp;<strong>acknowledging that they perform a
	difficult job and we love all of our city employees: which city
	department has the largest gap between your ideal of it and its
	current performance and what will you do about it in your first 6
	months?</strong></p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah,
	that's a great question and it's one I have a very specific answer
	for. And it's ISD, inspectional services. And it's not because the
	folks in that department don't do an incredible job and try very
	hard to handle the litany of tasks before them, which include
	dealing with rats, which includes inspections for small businesses,
	which includes inspections for those major developments, which
	includes health inspection - all these sorts of things. I think
	frankly they have a little bit too much on their plate. And
	currently they're without a director. We absolutely need to bring in
	the right kind of leadership for that department and bring in
	someone who's going to be innovative about how we actually go
	through this because whether it's opening small businesses or making
	changes to your home, ISD is at the center of so many of the things
	that make our city go, and unfortunately they've historically for
	many many years been understaffed and had a lot on their plate. I
	would look to figure out if there's a better division of labor
	there, if we can bring in leadership that is going to think
	differently about how that department can perform. And frankly, I
	would try to make their job a little bit easier by streamlining
	permitting. And I know that one of our at-large candidates had the
	idea of a pop-up permit, I'd fight for that, too, so we can have
	more businesses in Somerville and less empty storefronts.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. Councilor?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Councilor
	Burnley's 100% correct. Inspectional services is the department most
	in need of a dramatic change. When you talk to people, whether
	they're, you know, a homeowner, a business owner, someone, anyone on
	the street, they're going to tell you about frustrations with
	inspectional services. Just today, I spent a significant amount of
	time listening to people just vent spleen about their frustrations
	with ISD. I got a lot of ideas on that front, starting with hiring a
	director who's going to buy into reforming what's going on there.
	The amount of energy spent on things like drywall screw inspections,
	versus the kind of enforcement people want, enforcement that that
	protects the health and safety of our city, it seems like we have
	priorities completely backwards in terms of- making it almost
	impossible to get solar panels turned on and activated on your roof,
	or to add an a bathroom or a bedroom. Yeah. It has to start with
	ISD. And I will say I think we need to look beyond CitizenServe as a
	software platform. Councilor Burnley and I get to explore the back
	end of that as Councilors and the stories about what people go
	through with trying to use CitizenServe are just- they'll leave you
	so frustrated with the state of things. So I think it's about new
	leadership, it's about a culture change there, it's about new
	software for ISD, that actually help people navigate this system and
	prompt them when something new is due.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. Would you like a rebuttal?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
	In agreement, since my colleague was agreeing with me. I would just
	highlight as well for the work that ISD does, oftentimes their work
	is prescribed by an onerous permitting process that the city
	controls, and frankly the mayor has much more insight and control
	over than the Council does. As a Councilor, I've stepped into that
	role a little bit by changing some of the permitting fees to make it
	easier to open certain small businesses. As mayor, I will do a
	holistic change there.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Response?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I'm glad my colleague
	mentioned the hell that business owners go through trying to open a
	new business here, how long it takes, just the byzantine process of
	of trying to navigate that. We absolutely have to do something about
	that, to bring it down from the average. We hear 2 years is how long
	it takes to open a business. We have to do way better than that.
	I'll just say earlier today I heard a story: someone was looking to
	install a new garage door somewhere up in the North Shore and they
	said, &quot;Do I need a building permit for this?&quot; The answer
	was, only if you live in Somerville.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="rapidfire"></a>Rapid-fire
round (candidates not allowed to speak, only hold up yes/no signs)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, we're going to move on
	from the open Q&amp;A to the yes and no segment. Do you both have
	your flags? Excellent. I bet you can guess what means yes and what
	means no. You might think this is the easier segment because you
	just have to hold up a sign, but I think as humans, it is extremely
	tempting to want to explain yourself and your decision. And I'm
	ruthlessly crushing their response down to just holding up a sign.
	So, this is this is hard. And I appreciate both of you being willing
	to do this and respectfully ask you to not speak during this

<h2><a name="closing"></a>Closing statements</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;And
	now we go to closing statements. Councilor Burnley, you have two
	minutes and you go first.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Burnley:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. I'm incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity tonight to
	share my vision of a Somerville where everybody who has called this
	place home for decades or for even a few weeks can call home into
	the future. It's been my honor to serve as a city Councilor for the
	last four years. I've had the ability to wake up every day and know
	that I can make a difference in someone's life, whether it's by
	helping them open up their storefront, by connecting them to city
	services, or simply by showing up and listening to their stories and
	making sure that the Council is aware and fighting for change for
	everybody. But there's so much more that needs to be done, and the
	realm of the city council is limited in the extreme. As mayor, I
	will have the resources necessary from staffing to supports from my
	state and federal friends and colleagues, as someone who worked for
	senators Elizabeth Warren and Markey, to bring in the kind of
	resources that we need in order to make Gilman Square a square, in
	order to have per social housing and transformative policies at the
	local level. I know that we can do better if we come together as a
	community and fight for those values that we all say that we believe
	in. But it's going to take having a leader who is committed, who is
	clear, and who's going to have principled and pragmatic leadership
	in order to take us that step forward and ensure that Somerville is
	not just a place where only the wealthy can afford to live and
	thrive. It should be a place for all of us. And if you believe it
	should be a city for all of us, you should go to
	willieforsomerville.com and come join us while we knock doors, phone
	bank, and talk to our neighbors. Thank you.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Thank
	you. Councilor?</p>
	<li><p><strong>Wilson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah,
	the questions that we heard tonight, they cover a lot of the things
	we've been talking about as we built this campaign. I'm
	laser-focused on the issues impacting this city and I have a clear
	roadmap for how we're going to get to the point of addressing them
	meaningfully with programs and services. This is going to be hard
	work. You know, being a mayor is not easy. It's long hours. It's a
	lot of tough decisions. I know how to do the work. I grew up on a
	farm. I roll up my sleeves. I do that work. Our campaign is the
	Somerville campaign. We're supported by massive numbers of
	Somervillians who volunteer and donate. I'm asking for your vote.
	I'm asking for your help. Come out, knock doors with us, make phone
	calls, come stand at the polls on election day. I know about the
	issues that we've talked about tonight and during this campaign from
	being a Councilor, but also from those conversations on all those
	doors and at community events, you know, the thousands of of people
	who I've talked to during the course of this campaign. People are
	excited about a new day in Somerville. I'm excited to be a mayor
	that leads this city forward. Someone needs a mayor to come in,
	point to a north-star goal, get the people who work for the city
	bought in and fired up to do that work to make people's lives
	better. I'm that candidate, I'm asking for your vote, and I can't
	wait to get to work for you as your mayor. Let's do this.</p>
	<li><p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;Excellent. And with that, I
	will declare this debate completed. Thank you for coming.</p>
